# Tailwind CSS Gradient Troubleshooting

This repository demonstrates and solves uncommon issues related to gradients in Tailwind CSS.  Sometimes, gradients might not render correctly, even with seemingly correct code.  This can be due to various reasons, including typos, configuration errors, conflicting styles, and caching issues.

## Bug

The primary bug involves a gradient that fails to render correctly or doesn't render at all.  The likely causes are:

* **Typographical Errors:** Incorrect color names or class names.
* **Configuration Issues:** Missing or incorrect configurations in `tailwind.config.js`.
* **Conflicting Styles:** Other CSS rules overriding the gradient styles.
* **Caching Problems:** Browser caching of outdated stylesheets.
* **Plugin Conflicts:** Conflicts between Tailwind CSS and other CSS libraries or plugins.

## Solution

The solution focuses on systematically checking these potential issues and providing workarounds.  The core steps include:

1. Verify color names and class names.
2. Ensure correct configuration in `tailwind.config.js`.
3. Inspect computed styles to identify any conflicting rules.
4. Clear the browser's cache and force a hard reload.
5. Temporarily disable other CSS plugins to isolate the problem.

This repository provides example code to illustrate the problem and its solution.  The detailed explanation of each step is provided in the comments.
